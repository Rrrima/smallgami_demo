The user wants to modify a game object with the following request:

"____USER_MESSAGE____"

## Game Mechanism:
____MECHANISM____

## World Context:
____WORLD_DESCRIPTION____

## Current Object Configuration:
____OBJECT_CONFIG____

Please modify the object configuration based on the user's request. Remember:
- **DO NOT change the "id" field under any circumstances**
- **CRITICAL**: Respect mechanism constraints! For "christmas" and "running_christmas":
  * If object id is "box1", it MUST remain a hazard (onPlayerCollision.player = "die")
  * If object id is "box2", it MUST remain a collectible (onPlayerCollision.player = "score")
  * You can change appearance, size, speed, name - but NOT the core role
- Update visual properties (name, size) to match the user's description
- Adjust physics (speed, motion) to fit the described behavior
- Ensure collision behaviors match BOTH the mechanism constraints AND object's role
- Keep the configuration consistent with the world's theme and style
- **CRITICAL**: Use correct collision config structures:
  * onPlayerCollision: {"player": "...", "object": "..."} - NO "projectile" field!
  * onProjectileCollision: {"projectile": "...", "object": "..."} - NO "player" field!

Return the complete modified configuration and a summary of changes.

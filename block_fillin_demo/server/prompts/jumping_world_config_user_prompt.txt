Generate a detailed world configuration for a jumping/platformer game based on the following context:

**Game Description:**
{game_description}

**World Description:** {world_description}

**Visual Style:** {visual_style}

Based on this context, generate a complete WorldConfig with the following considerations:

1. **Lighting Configuration**:
   - Light direction should enhance the 3D depth and platform visibility
   - Light color should match the world's atmosphere and visual style
   - Light intensity should provide good visibility without being too harsh (0.6-1.0)

2. **Atmospheric Considerations**:
   - The lighting should support the narrative mood
   - Colors should complement the visual style described
   - The overall lighting should make platforms and collectables clearly visible

Ensure the lighting creates an immersive atmosphere that matches the world description while maintaining excellent gameplay visibility for platforming mechanics.

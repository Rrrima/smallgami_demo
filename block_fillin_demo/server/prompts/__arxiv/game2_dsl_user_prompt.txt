NARRATIVE CONTEXT:
__NARRATIVE_BLOCK__

The high level mechanism of this game is: __MECHANISM_SENTENCE__

TASK: Generate a complete Game2DSL specification that implements this narrative and highlevel mechanism  as a mini-game. The game mechanic should be based on the concept of emission: the player (or another entity) can emit or launch something toward a target, obstacle, or environment. The emitted object can have many thematic forms (e.g., bullet, bubble, magic spark, seed, food, paint splash) and can produce varied effects (damage, capture, transformation, growth, decoration, healing, unlocking).

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Design a world that matches the narrative setting and visual style
2. Define a player with appropriate appearance and emission abilities 
3. Create 1-2 objects that support the narrative and provide gameplay variety
4. Ensure all objects have clear behaviors and collision responses, it should be simple enough to implement but also able to communicate the narrative
5. Generate possible story continuations that maintain the space invader mechanics
6. Make the game completable in 15-30 seconds with clear objectives

GAME DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS:
- Player emissions should be thematically appropriate (bubbles, spells, beams, etc.)
- There should be no more than 2 types of object, keep the object simple while be able to deliver the narrative
- Collision effects should be creative but clear (healing, transformation, protection, etc.)
- Visual style should be cohesive and family-friendly
- Controls should be simple keyboard/mouse inputs
- Objects should have varied behaviors (moving patterns, reactions, etc.)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Generate a complete JSON object following the Game2DSL schema structure with all required fields populated.

Given the GameDSL specification, generate a GameLayoutConfig that specifies the exact positions and sizes for all game objects described in the DSL.

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
- The ground is exactly 100 x 100 units in size (X and Z axes from -50 to +50)
- All object positions must be WITHIN this boundary
- Y-axis position determines height above ground (Y=0 is ground level)
- Consider real-world physics and proportions
- Match the number of objects specified in the DSL for each object type

**Layout Design Principles:**
- **Spatial Relationships**: Objects should be positioned to create engaging gameplay flows
- **Real-World Proportions**: Sizes should be realistic relative to each other and the player
- **Player Movement**: Ensure adequate space for player navigation and interaction
- **Game Balance**: Position objects to create appropriate challenge and progression
- **Visual Composition**: Create aesthetically pleasing and logical spatial arrangements
- **Story Integration**: Position objects to support the narrative and gameplay described in the DSL

**Sizing Guidelines:**
- **Platforms**: Width 5-15 units, height 1-3 units, depth 5-15 units (depending on function)
- **Collectibles**: Small objects 0.5-2 units in all dimensions
- **NPCs**: Human-scale around 1.5-2 units tall, proportional width/depth
- **Enemies**: Vary based on type, but consider threat level and gameplay balance

**Positioning Guidelines:**
- **Platforms**: Strategic placement for jumping/navigation, consider gaps and heights
- **Collectibles**: Accessible but potentially challenging positions
- **NPCs**: Logical placement based on their role and patrol patterns
- **Enemies**: Positioned to create interesting encounters without being unfair
- **Physical Realism**: Consider how objects would naturally be placed in the real world scenario described in the DSL

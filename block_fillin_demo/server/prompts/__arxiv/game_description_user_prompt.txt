Design a doodle jump style game based on the following user-provided dimensions:

Overall context 
{context_elements}

Player Elements:
{player_elements}

World Elements:
{world_elements}

Style Elements:
{style_elements}

Object Elements:
{object_elements}
These elements (if any) will informa the design of the platforms the colletables!!

Narrative Elements:
{narrative_elements}


Create a comprehensive game description that includes:
0. First, think about what is the player, what is the world, what are the platforms and collctables (choose from the scene described in the object elements)
1. Try to integreate all the elements the user wants in each dimension, feel free to come up new element is what user provided is not enough 
2. the story description should be simple, in a format of I am _____, I am jumping on _____, collecting _____ to _____
3. the player should be a single character that is suitable to be in a jumping game with the above narrative, you should separate it with the decorations and environment described in the player related image reference.
4. when describe the player, make sure it is consistent with the story description 
5. the style description should be informative, this will be append to the player, world and object visual description to generate an asset image
6. the player character_visual description should be clear, you do not need to describe visua style, because we wil use a global visual style to do it. The motion descirpiton should be concise and information, considering the world and player itself
7. the world description should be detailed and will be used to send to a stable diffusion model to generate a skybox background
8. Platform types that fit the theme and provide interesting gameplay mechanics, no more than 2 types of platforms
9. Collectables that enhance the story and provide meaningful player progression, no more than 2 types of colletables
10. Both the platforms and the collectables should be informed by the object elements, if limited object elements are provided, try to infer from the player, world and the overall story.
11. New events should be achieved with small, natural progressions (like moving to a new area, slight ability changes, or environmental shifts), it should be described in a engaging about concise way like, informal language, like you are talking to the player, no more than 2
12. think about an event when the user fail (i.e., jump off the platform), instead of a game over, use this event to shape the story and move to a new scene, for example, you could fall into a new world.
13. DO NOT!! use words like 'try again', 'new advantrue', those are vague and not informative!!!
14. be aware of the overall context, if some parts of the game is not well specifiied in other element, make use of the overall context.

Ensure all elements work together to create a cohesive doodle jump experience that stays true to the core jumping mechanics while incorporating the user's creative vision.

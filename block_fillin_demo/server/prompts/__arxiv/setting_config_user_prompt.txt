Given a high-level GameDSL specification, generate a GameSettingConfig object with all necessary world, player, and object parameters WITHOUT positions and sizes.

The GameSettingConfig should follow what's described in the schema. Focus on creating the fundamental game mechanics, physics, materials, and visual properties.

**Rules:**
- Everything is in the lowpoly world, so make sure you make the style lowpoly!
- Use plausible physics values: e.g., gravity around (0, -9.8, 0), friction between 0.3–0.8, mass values appropriate for object types
- Material colors should match the tone of the `render` descriptions (e.g., "glowing blue" → use appropriate blue color from the available palette)
- Physics parameters should be realistic: platforms should be heavy and stable, collectibles should be light, enemies should have moderate mass
- Do NOT include object positions or sizes - these will be handled separately in the layout configuration
- Each object should have a "number" field indicating how many instances of that object type should be placed
- Ensure all physics parameters are consistent with the object types and game mechanics

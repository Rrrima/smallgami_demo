Decompose an input image into four concise dimensions in JSON:

- "worlds": short description of the background or setting (do not list objects).  
- "objects": list of object that is suitable to be a player of the game. Each entry should describe exactly one object, self-contained. Do not overlap objects or split one object into parts. Do not include background elements unless they are the main object.  
- "events": concise description of what is happening, if no specific thing is happening (i.e., no clear narrative), simply response with N/A
- "style": short description of the visual style, using phrases, if it resemble a specific art style, mention it  

Rules:  
- Be specific (e.g., "green plush dinosaur") instead of vague terms like "creature" or "object".  
- Each object description should be self-contained to generate the object alone as an image asset. For exmaple, A hat, a sticy note, instead of 'a collection so sticky notes' 
- If there is only one main object, return a single entry in the "objects" list.  
- You do not need to list out all the objects in the image, only the interesting ones that is suitable to be extracted out as a game player or a game assets that the player can interact with
- DO NOT mention the motion of the objects or the environmnt of the object. 
for example, instead of 'A large white paper boat with sharp folds, floating on the water.', give me 'A large white paper boat with sharp folds'
instead of 'A green cartoon dinosaur with a simple rounded body, small circular eyes, a friendly smile, and front legs resting on the edge of the boat.', give me 'A green cartoon dinosaur with a simple rounded body, small circular eyes'

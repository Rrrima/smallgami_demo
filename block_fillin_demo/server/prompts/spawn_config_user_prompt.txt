Please analyze how the object changes affect spawn behavior and update the spawn configurations accordingly. Consider:
- Does the spawn frequency need adjustment based on new size/speed/role?
- Are the position ranges still appropriate?
- Should the spawn likelihood change?
- Do scale variation ranges make sense with the new object size?

Return the COMPLETE list of all spawn configurations with appropriate modifications. Preserve spawn controllers that don't reference this object unchanged.

The user wants to modify the player character configuration.

User Request: ____USER_MESSAGE____

Current Player Configuration:
____PLAYER_CONFIG____

Based on the user's request, modify the player configuration appropriately.

## Examples of Modifications:

**Movement Speed & Feel:**
- "Make player faster" → moveSpeed: 80-100 (from typical 50)
- "Make player slower" → moveSpeed: 25-35
- "More responsive" → friction: 10-15 (from typical 7)
- "Slippery/ice skating" → friction: 2-4
- "Heavier feel" → mass: 15-20, friction: 10 (compensate for momentum)
- "Lighter/floatier" → mass: 3-8

**Jumping:**
- "Higher jumps" → jumpPower: 60-80 (from typical 50)
- "Lower jumps" → jumpPower: 25-40
- "Enable double jump" → jumpOnlyOnGround: false, maxJumpCount: 2
- "Only jump on ground" → jumpOnlyOnGround: true
- "Triple jump" → maxJumpCount: 3
- "Bouncy like a ball" → restitution: 0.6-0.8
- "No bouncing" → restitution: 0.1-0.2
- "Spam jumping" → jumpInterval: 50-100 (from default 200)

**Animation Style:**
- "More cartoony" → jumpSquishScale: 0.85, jumpStretchScale: 1.15, duration: 600-800
- "Subtle animation" → jumpSquishScale: 0.92, jumpStretchScale: 1.05, duration: 300-400
- "Exaggerated squash" → jumpSquishScale: 0.75-0.85, jumpStretchScale: 1.2-1.3
- "Quick snappy" → duration: 250-350
- "Slow elastic" → duration: 700-900

**Size & Position:**
- "Bigger player" → size: 8-12 (from typical 5)
- "Smaller player" → size: 3-4
- "Move spawn left" → startPosition.x: decrease value
- "Higher spawn" → startPosition.y: increase value
- "Rotate 90 degrees" → initialRotation: [0, 1.57, 0] (90° in radians)

**Shooting (if bullets config exists):**
- "Rapid fire" → bullets.cooldown: 100-150, maxCount: 30-50
- "Slow powerful shots" → bullets.cooldown: 800-1500, maxCount: 3-5
- "Faster bullets" → bullets.speed: 15-25
- "Longer range" → bullets.maxDistance: 150-200
- "Bigger bullets" → bullets.shape: increase width/height
- "Blue bullets" → bullets.color: {r: 0.2, g: 0.4, b: 1.0}
- "Bright bullets" → bullets.opacity: 0.9-1.0

**Combined Examples:**
- "Heavy slow character" → mass: 18, moveSpeed: 35, friction: 10, jumpPower: 45
- "Fast agile character" → mass: 6, moveSpeed: 85, friction: 12, jumpPower: 55, jumpInterval: 150
- "Bouncy pinball" → restitution: 0.75, jumpPower: 60, friction: 4
- "Cartoony platformer feel" → jumpSquishScale: 0.87, jumpStretchScale: 1.12, duration: 550, restitution: 0.35

CRITICAL RULES:
- **ONLY use the exact fields shown in the current configuration**
- **DO NOT add fields like**: maxVelocityY, stability, walkingStyle, walkingJumpHeight, walkingJumpDuration, gravity, acceleration, velocity
- **ONLY valid fields are**: size, jumpPower, moveSpeed, friction, mass, restitution, jumpAnimationDuration, jumpSquishScale, jumpStretchScale, jumpOnlyOnGround, maxJumpCount, jumpInterval, bullets, startPosition, initialRotation

IMPORTANT:
- Return a JSON object with TWO fields:
  1. **playerConfig**: The COMPLETE PlayerConfig JSON with ALL required fields
  2. **summary**: A brief 2-3 sentence explanation of what you changed
- Only modify playerConfig fields relevant to the user's request
- Keep all other playerConfig fields UNCHANGED from the current configuration
- Use ONLY the fields present in the current configuration - do not invent new fields
- Ensure values are in valid ranges:
  - size: 2-20
  - moveSpeed: 10-150
  - jumpPower: 20-100
  - mass: 0.5-30
  - friction: 1-20
  - restitution: 0.0-1.0
  - jumpSquishScale: 0.7-0.98
  - jumpStretchScale: 1.02-1.5
  - jumpAnimationDuration: 200-1000
- Maintain exact JSON structure matching PlayerConfigChangeResponse schema
- If bullets config doesn't exist and user requests shooting, add bullets configuration
- If bullets exists but not mentioned, keep it unchanged

Example response format:
```json
{
  "playerConfig": { ...complete player config... },
  "summary": "I increased the player's moveSpeed to 85 and reduced mass to 6 to create a lighter, more agile character. Also added double jump capability by setting maxJumpCount to 2."
}
```

Return the response as valid JSON.

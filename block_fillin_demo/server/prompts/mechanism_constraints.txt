# Game Mechanism Constraints

Each game mechanism has specific object role requirements that MUST be followed.

## christmas (Dodge & Catch)
**Description**: Player must dodge falling hazards and catch falling collectibles.
**Object Role Constraints**:
- **box1**: MUST be a hazard. Player MUST die when hit.
  - onPlayerCollision.player MUST be "die"
  - Typically small and fast-falling
  - Visual: Dangerous/harmful objects (spikes, bombs, obstacles)
- **box2**: MUST be a collectible. Player MUST gain score when caught.
  - onPlayerCollision.player MUST be "score"
  - Typically medium-sized and moderate-speed
  - Visual: Valuable/desirable objects (gifts, coins, stars)

## running_christmas (Run & Catch)
**Description**: Player runs forward while dodging and catching objects that move toward them.
**Object Role Constraints**:
- **box1**: MUST be a hazard. Player MUST die when hit.
  - onPlayerCollision.player MUST be "die"
  - Objects move horizontally (negative X velocity)
  - Visual: Obstacles in the path
- **box2**: MUST be a collectible. Player MUST gain score when caught.
  - onPlayerCollision.player MUST be "score"
  - Objects move horizontally (negative X velocity)
  - Visual: Collectible items in the path

## flappy_bird (Flappy Bird)
**Description**: Player flies through gaps between obstacles by tapping to flap.
**Object Role Constraints**:
- Pipes/obstacles spawn in pairs (top and bottom)
- Player MUST avoid hitting pipes (die on collision)
- Objects are typically static or slowly moving
- Score is gained by passing through gaps, not by collision

## platform_forest (Platform Jump)
**Description**: Player jumps on platforms to reach higher ground.
**Object Role Constraints**:
- Platforms allow player to jump (onPlayerCollision.player = "jump")
- Some objects may be collectibles (score on touch)
- Some objects may be hazards (die on touch)
- Platforms are typically static (motionType = 0) or moving horizontally (motionType = 2)

## General Constraint Rules:
1. When user modifies object description, the core ROLE must remain consistent with mechanism
2. Visual appearance can change (e.g., "spike ball" → "falling meteor") but collision behavior MUST stay aligned with mechanism
3. If mechanism is "Dodge & Catch" and object is box1, it MUST remain a hazard regardless of description
4. If mechanism is "Dodge & Catch" and object is box2, it MUST remain a collectible regardless of description
5. Size, speed, and visual style can be adjusted freely within role constraints

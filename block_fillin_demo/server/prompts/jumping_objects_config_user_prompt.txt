Generate detailed object configurations for a jumping/platformer game based on the following context:

**Game Description:**
{game_description}

**Platform Descriptions:**
{platform_descriptions}

**Collectable Descriptions:**
{collectable_descriptions}

**Visual Style:** {visual_style}

Based on this context, generate a complete ObjectConfig with the following considerations:

1. **Platform Configurations**:
   - Sizes should vary to create interesting level layouts (typically 1-4 units wide)
   - Movement ranges should create dynamic but fair challenges
   - Movement speeds should be predictable and learnable (0.5-3.0)
   - Disappear mechanics should add tension without being unfair
   - Bounce multipliers should enhance gameplay flow (1.0-2.0)

2. **Collectable Configurations**:
   - Sizes should be visible but not overwhelming (0.3-0.8)
   - Float animations should be appealing and noticeable
   - Emissive intensity should make them attractive to collect (0.5-2.0)
   - Effects should provide meaningful gameplay benefits
   - Dialogue chances should balance story with gameplay flow (0.1-0.4)

3. **Gameplay Balance**:
   - Objects should support the narrative and visual style
   - Difficulty should progress appropriately
   - All values should create engaging and fair gameplay

Ensure all configurations create a cohesive gameplay experience that matches the game's story and visual aesthetic.

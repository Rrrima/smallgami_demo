Generate a detailed player configuration for a jumping/platformer game based on the following context:

**Game Description:**
{game_description}

**Player Character:**
- Character Visual: {player_visual}
- Motion Style: {motion_style}
- Story: {player_story}
- Goal: {player_goal}

**Visual Style:** {visual_style}

Based on this context, generate a complete PlayerConfig with the following considerations:

1. **Physics Settings**: 
   - Gravity should feel natural but allow for fun platforming (typically 15-25)
   - Jump power should allow reaching platforms with satisfying arc (typically 8-15)
   - Move speed should match the character type and feel responsive (typically 5-12)
   - Max velocity Y should prevent excessive falling speed (typically 15-25)
   - Friction should provide good control without being too slippery (0.1-0.3)

2. **Jump Animation Settings**:
   - Jump animation duration should be snappy but visible (100-300ms)
   - Jump squish scale should provide satisfying feedback (0.7-0.9)
   - Jump stretch scale should emphasize the jump action (1.1-1.4)

Ensure all values create engaging platformer gameplay that matches the character's story and visual style. The physics should feel responsive and fun while supporting the narrative context.
